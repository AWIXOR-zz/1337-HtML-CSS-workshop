### Note !!!
This workshop will not be teaching you the basics of html, css or js. 
The purpose of this workshop is to help you better understand how to impliment these 3 languages in a real web app that we might deploy after.
## Setting up the dev envirement
### 1. Required software

Before starting, make sure your computer has up-to-date versions of the following installed:

- [Node/NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) (choose the **LTS** option, which should be version 16.13)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
  - If using a Mac, also follow [these steps](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line) to install the `code` terminal command.
  - If you already had VS Code installed, check for updates!
### 2. Installing and opening the project

- Open VS Code and then press ```ctrl + ` ``` (backtick, in top left corner of keyboard) to open the built-in terminal
- Use the `cd` (change directory) command to find an appropriate place for your code
- Type `git clone https://github.com/awixor` into the terminal to pull down a copy of the workshop code
- Type `cd 1337-frontend-basics-workshop` to change your current directory to the workshop folder
<!-- - Type `npm install` to install all of the project dependencies -->
- Type `code -r .` to open the bootcamp code in VS Code
> If on a Mac, be sure you've followed [these steps](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line) first to make the `code` command available.

## Your Job
In this repo you will find in the folder `Our-web-app`. It's the initial setup for the application.

This is the file structure:
```bash
.
├── design              # Folder where you will find the final design of the app.
├── images              # Folder contains all the assets (images and icons) you will need
├── .gitignore          # gitignore file same as the one you saw in C pool.
├── index.html          # The is the file you will be editing.
└── style-guide.md      # Some styles guide for the web page.
```
Basically you need to build a web page that looks like the image below using the assets given.

### Make it work
